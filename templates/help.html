  <h1 id="using-the-site">Using the Site</h1>
  <p>
    This section details how to use the site. If you need any more help please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.
  </p>
  <h2 id="entry-badges">Badges</h2>
  <p>
    Every entry can have a few badges to denote some extraneous information about it. They are as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="badge danger" title="Entry is meant for adults">Adult</span>
        <span class="explanation">The entry is meant for adult audiences.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="badge warning" title="Entry might have quality issues">Unverified</span>
        <span class="explanation">The entry has not been verified by editors to have the correct information.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="badge success" title="Entry is a movie">Movie</span>
        <span class="explanation">The entry is for a movie.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="badge info" title="Entry originated from an outside source">External</span>
        <span class="explanation">The entry originated from <a href="https://kitsunekko.net">Kitsunekko</a> or <a href="https://jpsubbers.com/">JPSubbers</a>.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2 id="searching">Searching</h2>
  <p>
    On the front page and on an entry's page there is a search bar that allows you to search and filter entries. This search supports any language that the entry has, such as Romaji, English, or Japanese.
    Likewise, searching by an AniList URL is supported.
  </p>
  <h2 id="account-management">Account Management</h2>
  <p>
    You can change your password by clicking on your username on the navbar, when logged on.
    Once your password is changed, you will be logged out of all logged on sessions.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is currently no way to delete an account. <a href="/contact">Contact the administrators</a> if needed.
  </p>
  <h2 id="downloading-files">Downloading Files</h2>
  <p>
    You can download files by clicking on the link in the file entry. You can also bulk download files by selecting multiple files using the checkbox and then clicking the Download button. This will give you a ZIP file with all the subtitles you selected. You can also Shift click the checkbox to select multiple files in a range.
  </p>
  <h2 id="anilist-integration">AniList Integration</h2>
  <p>
    The site has support for reading a user's <a href="https://anilist.co/">AniList</a> account and having
    a filtered view of the site's subtitles based off of the user's watching, rewatching, and planning lists.
    This also filters watched episodes from the file list, to the best of the site's ability.
  </p>
  {%- let example_url = "/anilist/example"|canonical_url -%}
  <p>
    This feature is accessed by going to <code>{{ "/anilist/:username"|canonical_url }}</code> and replacing
    <code>:username</code> with your username, for example if your username is <strong>example</strong> then visiting <a href='{{ example_url }}'>{{ example_url }}</a> will show you the integration.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to note that your AniList anime list must be public for this feature to work for your account.
  </p>
  <h2 id="reporting-files">Reporting Files</h2>
  <p>
    If you find files that are not proper subtitles or have other issues, you can report these files to the administrator by using the report button. To report, select the files using the checkbox and then press Report button to provide a reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also report entire entries for issues by not selecting any files when reporting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that reporting currently requires an account.
  </p>
  <h2 id="changing-settings">Settings</h2>
  <p>
    By accessing the cog icon on the navbar you can change your settings such as displayed language.
  </p>
  <h1 id="upload-guidelines">Upload Guidelines</h1>
  <p>
    In order to maintain a clean and navigable site, it is imperative that things uploaded meet a specific criteria.
  </p>
  <p>Creating a folder or uploading files requires an account. No email or personal information is stored.</p>
  <p>
    Note that due to the automatic downloads from <a href="https://kitsunekko.net">Kitsunekko</a>, not all of the subtitles will meet these requirements. However, please strive to do so.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you find any file that breaks these rules or needs to be fixed, please use the <a href="#reporting-files">Report feature</a> to notify the administrators and editors to fix it.
  </p>
  <h2 id="naming-scheme">Naming Scheme</h2>
  <p>
    Subtitle filenames should generally have the same name as the filename of the video it came from, except with an <code>.srt</code> or <code>.ass</code> extension instead of the video extension. This allows users to quickly identify what video the subtitles originated from, and hopefully allows them to consistently modify the timing relative to their own files.
  </p>
  <p>
    For rips directly from streaming sources or Blu-ray, please <strong>include the name of the source</strong> and consider standardizing the filename to match the other files on the site for the convenience of the user. If the release uses a different numbering scheme than the standard one as sometimes the case with Netflix, also consider including the title of the episode. Examples of common formats:
    <ul>
      <li><code>Kaguya-sama Love Is War.S02E01.Netflix.CC.ja.srt</code></li>
      <li><code>Pokemon Horizon.S01E01.Amazon.ja[sdh].srt</code></li>
      <li><code>史上最強の大魔王、村人Aに転生する.S01E01.村人A.WEBRip.Netflix.ja[cc].srt</code></li>
      <li><code>モンティ・パイソン・アンド・ホーリー・グレイル.BDrip.ja.srt</code></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    At the bare minimum, retimed files should be prefixed with <code>[Group]</code> so users can distinguish what release they are meant to be used for. Files can also be suffixed with <code>(retimed from Source)</code> to help users discern where the subtitles come from if they have issues. In addition, users can reference the name of the source file to ascertain whether the file contains closed captions and what ASS styling it might have. (Example: <code>[Vodes] Jujutsu Kaisen 0 (2021) [v2] [BD 1080p HEVC Dual-Audio] (retimed from Netflix).srt</code>)
  </p>
  <p>
    Dual language files should be suffixed with either <code>[TAG1, TAG2]</code> or <code>.tag1-tag2</code>  to reflect the languages contained in the file. Recommended tags are JPN, CHI, CHS, CHT, ENG, ja, en, and cn.
  </p>
  <h2 id="creating-folders">Creating Folders</h2>
  <p>
    Creating a folder requires the entry to have an AniList ID, backed by an <a href="https://anilist.co">AniList</a> URL. For Live Action entries, this requires a <a href="https://themoviedb.org/">TMDB</a> URL. This is necessary to power the search features and overall organization of the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a series has multiple seasons in AniList, then it should be put in the appropriate folder for that season. In other words, there should be one folder per AniList entry. Currently, as TMDB joins seasons into a single entry, they are likewise combined in the site. In other words, for TMDB entries there is one entry for multiple seasons.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a folder does not exist for that AniList or TMDB entry, feel free to make one before uploading it. Chances are however, that it exists. Use the search bar before making a new folder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users that are editors can create a folder without this requirement, and this requirement is also relaxed for entries created from Kitsunekko.
  </p>
  <h2 id="file-types">Supported File Types</h2>
  <p>
    The following file types are supported:
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>.srt</code></li>
      <li><code>.ass</code></li>
      <li><code>.ssa</code></li>
      <li><code>.zip</code></li>
      <li><code>.7z</code></li>
      <li><code>.sub</code></li>
      <li><code>.sup</code></li>
      <li><code>.idx</code></li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    It is recommended to upload only <code>.srt</code> or <code>.ass</code> files for best results.
    The other file types are provided merely for legacy reasons or for supporting picture based subtitles.
    Try to avoid uploading a <code>.zip</code> or <code>.7z</code> file since its contents cannot be investigated without downloading.
  </p>
  <h2 id="archives">Archives</h2>
  <p>
    As mentioned earlier, keeping files outside of an archive is preferred. The main use case for uploading archives is for uploading picture based subtitles such as <code>.sub</code>, files that are typically paired together such as <code>.sup</code> and <code>.idx</code>, or font packs for <code>.ass</code> files.
  </p>
  <p>
    Generally it is preferred to upload <code>.zip</code> files over <code>.7z</code> files. However, since <code>.7z</code> files offer better compression they can be used to upload large files that are larger than the current file size limit of 16 MiB.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the built-in unzipper on Windows is unable to handle file paths larger than 260 characters, therefore to avoid issues, make sure your file names and folders in the archive are not excessively long.
  </p>
  <h2 id="ai-files">AI Generated Files</h2>
  <p>
    AI generated files, such as those generated by <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper/">Whisper</a>, are discouraged and only allowed if there are no alternative official subtitles available. If there are official subtitles released for an episode they should take priority over the AI generated subtitles and the old AI generated subtitles should be reported for deletion.
  </p>
  <p>
    AI generated files should be clearly marked as such in the filename to not trick people into downloading them. For example, it should be suffixed with <code>[Generated by Whisper]</code>.
  </p>
  <h2 id="converted-files">Converted and OCR Files</h2>
  <p>
    When converting a file from <code>.ass</code> to <code>.srt</code>, please ensure that the encoding is UTF-8 <strong>without</strong> BOM.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a file is a result of running an OCR tool on a picture-based subtitle, please suffix and label the file as <code>(OCR converted)</code> to signal to readers that the file might have errors.
  </p>
  <h2 id="deleting-files">Deleting Files</h2>
  <p>
    Files can currently only be deleted by an administrator. If you find a file that needs to be deleted, please report it using the <a href="#reporting-files">Report feature</a>. The administrators and editors will handle the file if necessary.
  </p>
  <h1 id="editor-user">Editor Users</h1>
  <p>
    Certain users are designated <span class="badge info" title="User is an editor">Editor</span> which gives them special privileges with helping maintain the site's quality.
  </p>
  <h2 id="becoming-an-editor">Becoming an Editor</h2>
  <p>
    At the moment, there is no established process for becoming an editor. If you are a prolific uploader and are active in <a href="/contact">our community</a>, the administrators might grant it to you.
  </p>
  <h2 id="moving-entries">Moving Entries</h2>
  <p>
    One of the abilities that editors gain is the ability to move files to another, and correct, entry. In order to do this, you need to select multiple files and then press the Move button to move it to another directory entry.
  </p>
  <h2 id="editing-info">Editing Information</h2>
  <p>
    Editors can edit information of an entry using the Edit button. Most of it is straightforward. For editing the notes of an entry, you can include any type of information that would be helpful to add with that note. The maximum length of the notes is currently 1024 characters. It also supports <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a> for formatting.
  </p>
  <h2 id="romanization">Romanization Guidelines</h2>
  <p>
    Generally, the site tries to follow the <a href="https://submission-manual.anilist.co/anilist/Romanization-and-Title-Formatting-bb5cddde10ac4c939d5f6585aa190a15">AniList Romanization Guidelines</a>. They are reproduced below with amendments.
  </p>
  <p>
    The romanization of Japanese names and titles is done in a variation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization#Variants">Traditional Hepburn</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Alternate spellings advocated by the creator is typically preferred.</li>
      <li>Macrons are <strong>not</strong> used.</li>
      <li>Loanwords are written properly in their respective language, for example Maid instead of Meido.</li>
      <li>Words using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokuon">Sokuon (促音)</a> are spelled out by duplicating the next letter, for example 'っち', 'っちゃ', 'っちょ' are romanized as 'cchi', 'ccha', and 'ccho' respectively.</li>
      <li>'を' is always written as 'wo'.</li>
      <li>'ん' is always written as 'n', for example せんぱい is senpai not sempai.</li>
      <li>'じゃない' is written as 'ja Nai'.</li>
      <li>Particles are <strong><em>never</em></strong> capitalized.</li>
      <li>Honorific prefixes such as 'O' (お) and 'Go' (ご) must be written as part of the noun without the use of a dash.
        <ul>
          <li>お山 is written as <em>Oyama</em>.</li>
          <li>ご注文 is written as <em>Gochuumon</em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Suffixes, counters, and honorific suffixes must be written as part of the noun <strong><em>with</em></strong> the use of a dash.
        <ul>
          <li>宮本君 is written as <em>Miyamoto-kun</em>.</li>
          <li>王子さま is written as <em>Ouji-sama</em>.</li>
          <li>番外編 is written as <em>Bangai-hen</em>.</li>
          <li>7人 is written as <em>7-nin</em>.</li>
          <li>An exception is made with nouns that includes the suffix 'tachi' (たち/達), where it’s used to make a noun plural (Example: 私たち is written as <em>Watashitachi</em>.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Words adopted into English are written in that standard (Example: <em>Tokyo</em> and <em>Osaka</em> instead of <em>Toukyou</em> and <em>Oosaka</em> respectively).</li>
      <li>Full-width punctuation and numbers should <strong><em>always</em></strong> be converted to half-width of equivalent, for example 。 to ., ！ to !, ？ to ?, ７ to 7, etc.</li>
      <li>If no particles are present between a noun and a verb, they must be written as two separate words. This is most common with ~suru verbs.
        <ul>
          <li>結婚する is written as <em>Kekkon Suru</em>.</li>
          <li>転生したら is written as <em>Tensei Shitara</em>.</li>
          <li>An exception is made towards all forms of Aisuru (愛する) and Koisuru (恋する), where both words are most commonly written as a single word.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If the subtitle of the series uses tildes or hyphens to differentiate between the title and subtitle, use a colon instead. (Example: アイシテル〜海容〜 is written as <em>Aishiteru: Kaiyo</em>).</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
